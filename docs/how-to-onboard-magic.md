# Logging In with a Magic Link (for Personal Emails)

This convenient method provides a passwordless login for users who are not using a university email address. It's quick, secure, and eliminates the need to remember another password.

**What You'll Experience:**

1. **The Magic Link Form:** After entering your personal email and clicking "Continue," the login screen will transform. You'll see a message indicating that a magic link will be sent to your email, with your email address already pre-filled.

4. **Opening the Magic Link Email:** Open the email from Projexa. Inside, you'll find a prominent "Log In" button or a direct link.

5. **Logging In Instantly:** Click the "Log In" button or the magic link within the email. This action will instantly log you into Projexa and take you directly to your dashboard.
