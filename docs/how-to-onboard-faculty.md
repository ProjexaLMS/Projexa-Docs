# Faculty Profile Completion: "Fill Your Information"

This is a crucial step specifically for faculty members who are logging in for the first time or whose profiles are not yet fully complete. It ensures we have the necessary details to provide you with the best experience.

**What You'll Experience:**

1. **Automatic Redirection:** If your faculty profile isn't complete after your initial login, Projexa will automatically direct you to a dedicated "Complete Your Profile" page. You won't be able to access other parts of the application until this is done.

   * **Your School:** The name of your academic school or department.  
   * **Phone Number:** Your contact phone number.  
   * **Employee ID:** Your unique employee identification number.  
   * **Area of Specialization:** Your primary academic or professional area of expertise.
