## 1. Team Management

Teams are a core component of the Projexa experience, enabling collaborative project work. The system provides robust features for team formation and management.

### Team Size Configuration

Projexa enforces specific team size limits to ensure effective collaboration and project management. These limits are set by coordinators.

*   **Minimum Team Size:** The smallest number of participants allowed in a team.
*   **Maximum Team Size:** The largest number of participants allowed in a team.

### Cross-Section Teams

The system can be configured to allow students from different academic sections to form teams together. This allows for more diverse team compositions.
