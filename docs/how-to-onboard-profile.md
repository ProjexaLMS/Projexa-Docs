# Personalizing Your Profile: Uploading Your Profile Picture

Your profile picture helps personalize your experience on Projexa, making your interactions more engaging and recognizable.

**What You'll Experience:**

1. **Prompt to Upload:** If you don't yet have a profile picture associated with your account, Projexa will guide you to a dedicated page to upload one. This ensures your profile is complete and ready for collaboration.

2. **Selecting and Cropping Your Image:**  
     
   * **Select Image:** Click on the designated area (e.g., "Click to select an image") to open your file explorer. Choose an image file (JPG or PNG are recommended).  
   * **Cropping Tool:** Once selected, your image will appear within a cropping tool. This tool allows you to adjust the image, zoom in or out, and select the perfect square area for your profile picture. This ensures your picture looks great and fits perfectly.
